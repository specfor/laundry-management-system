One of my old projects I did with some of my friends after completing our A/L exams, waiting to enter into a university.

Api is written in php. It does not use any framework like Laravel. It is made from ground-up while learning about these concepts. It is made similar to MVC architecture.


All frontend apps are written using VueJs framework as it was easier to learn at the time as we were entering to learn these concepts.
